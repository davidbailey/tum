## [Sustainable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_transport) [Transportation Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_network)

* derived from sustainable forestry ([Hans Carl von Carlowitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Carl_von_Carlowitz))
* typical reasons for transportation projects (in order): efficency, safety, money, environment
* technical and orgazational structure for transport: infrastructure, vehicles, rules
* Elements: Nodes (important for capacity/performance) and Links
* Transport Offer: network + services
* Qualities
  * Connexity: are the points connected or not?
  * Connectivity: quality of interconnection = number of links / number of nodes. cul-de-sacs are poor connectivity
* Shapes
  * Radial e.g. Los Angeles Metrolink
  * Radial Ring e.g. European motorways around a city
  * Grid (Raster) e.g. Manhattan street network, Munich Maxvorstadt street network
* Scale
  * International
    * Airplane, (High-speed) Rail, Car/Bus
  * National
    * Airplane, (High-speed) Rail, Car/Bus
  * State
    * Airplane, (High-speed) Rail, Car/Bus
  * **Regional**
    * **Rail**, Car/Bus
    * [Functional Urban Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larger_urban_zone)
    * Polycentric to spread the demand, but keep it concentrated
    * Transit-oriented Development
    * Integration - professional, spatial, temporal, orgazational, methodological, poltical
  * County
    * Rail, Car/Bus
  * City
    * Rail, Car/Bus, Bicycle
  * **Neighborhood**
    * Car/Bus, **Bicycle**, **Walk**
    * Up to 2km (30 minute walk) (more feeling than strict rule - could be shorter or longer)
    * Minimum 100 people/hectar for compact, walkable, bikeable.
    * Neighborhood is imporant for livable places, urban mobility, economic development, space/time efficency, pollution reduction, environmental friendliness, cost effectiveness, health, young and old mobility...
    * Neighborhood needs close destinations, network connections, bike/walk spaces, protection, a positive cultural climate, processes, involvement, data, tools.
    * Ground floor is the interaction between people and building - needs shops, restaurants, life - provides safety/security
    * Good things: parklets, benches, walking school bus, snow removal from sidewalk/bike lanes, slow/safe traffic, curb bulb-outs, elevated intersections, traffic island
    * Traffic Calming Areas - no priority for cars, max speed 4-7km/h, no sidewalk - hard for non-sighted orientation - still need a safe place. Similar to shared spaces.
    * Different speeds builds a hierarchy where cars naturally find faster streets - don't make everything slow
    * Traffic Calming goals - equality for all, more safe, less air and noise pollution | methods - shrink the road, disallow through traffic / shift vehicles to other streets, shift people to other modes
    * Marketing and communication

### Buzzwords

* Public Transportation Priority
* Non-motorized Transportaion
* Public Spaces
* Public Transportation Integration
* Transportation Demand Management
* High Quality Public Trasnportation
* Land Use Policies
* Car Restrictions

### Moving from Traditional (Car-focused) to Sustainable (People-focused)

* Improve Walk, Bike, Public Transportation, Cars, Planes
  * Long timeline e.g. most Metros have taken 100 years to build, but bus lanes are quicker (cheaper)
  * Must happen before reducing cars
* Demand is influenced by policy, price, etc., not a given
* Design public transportation aroud people, not technology
  * Traditional approach: pick technology, fit city to technology, force people to adopt - results in high-costs and low ridership
  * Successful approach: design around people: network, easy, fast; evaluate options from the city perspective ($$$), decide
    * Mimic the good aspects of cars: e.g. high-speed, high-frequency (12+ vehicles/hr), high-quality e.g. BRT

### [Bicycle Transportation Planning and Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle_transportation_planning_and_engineering)

* Features
  * Bicycles don't experience congestion (nearly as much as cars)
  * Bicycles don't pollute (increased health and land value)
  * Bicycles cost less (social mobility)
  * Bicycles don't take up space or divide communities
* Germany: 4th grade bicycle test with police as part of school
* [Economic Impacts from Bicycle and Pedestrian Street Improvements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nR74b2cidKI) [www.youtube.com]
  * Depends on scale of the project, type of facility, types of benefits - transport, property values, economic development, ecosystem services, health, recreation, aesthetics, safety
  * Perceptions - not so good, reality - good
  * Property values = depend on ease of access to good bike facility, extensiveness of network
* How to promote cycling
  * Routing
    * Design a Bike Network
    * Add Bike Lanes
    * Improve Comfort
    * Add Signage
  * Improve
    * Identify Dangerous Areas
    * Upgrade to Protected Bike Lanes
    * Improve Signal Timing for Bicycles
  * Next Level
    * Fill Missing Links
    * Add Bridges and Tunnels
  * Result: people bike more for short trips

### [Transport Planning in Delft, Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5_0T51vOuI) [www.youtube.com]

* Want to increase bike/ped mode share
* Decrease
  * Pollution - Reduce car traffic and speed
  * Noise - Reduce Speed
  * Injuries - High injury network
  * Fire Department - Don't calm these roads
  * Parks - Connect the parks
  * Light Rail > Bus : Predictalbe, faster, more comfortable, etc.
* Road Design - National Standard
  * Highway > 70kph w/ Protected Bike Lane
  * Arterial = 50kph w/ Protected Bike Lane
  * Residential < 30kph w/ Bikes in the Street
  * But not for Delft
    * Not enough space
    * No green space
* New road design
  * Mixed use
  * 10,000 cars/day or more
  * Shops and Houses
  * 40kph design speed, not signed speed
  * => safer, quieter, less pollution
  * smaller lanes, special median (stones), attention markings, raised crossings with pedestrian islands, roundabouts instead of lights

### The North American Model

* Reasons why cars are the dominant transportation mode 
  * personal freedom
  * zoning - residential and commercial are farther from each other, not mixed
  * the US got the car earlier than Europe
  * people liked the bus more than the streetcar - more accessibility, faster
  * parking minimums
